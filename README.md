## Project Overview
As part of the job simulation, the project involved:
- Extracting and analyzing key financial data from publicly available SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q reports).
- Using Python for data preprocessing, manipulation, and trend analysis.
- Applying rule-based logic and AI techniques to enhance chatbot responses.
- Developing a chatbot that provides users with real-time insights into financial health and performance indicators.

## Key Learnings
- **Financial Data Extraction:** Understanding how to extract financial metrics such as revenue, net income, and operating expenses from SEC reports.
- **Data Manipulation:** Using Python libraries like pandas for processing and structuring financial data.
- **Chatbot Development:** Implementing rule-based logic for answering finance-related queries.
- **AI Integration:** Exploring methods for integrating AI models to improve chatbot intelligence.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, BeautifulSoup (for web scraping), regex (for text parsing)
- **AI Tools:** Rule-based logic, Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts
- **Data Sources:** SEC EDGAR database for financial reports

## Data Sources
The primary data source for this project was the **SEC EDGAR database**, which provides publicly available financial reports (10-K and 10-Q filings) for publicly traded companies. These reports contain:
- **Income Statement:** Revenue, COGS, net income, EBITDA
- **Balance Sheet:** Assets, liabilities, shareholder equity
- **Cash Flow Statement:** Operating, investing, and financing activities

## Implementation Process
1. **Data Collection:** Retrieved and parsed financial reports using Python scripts.
2. **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Structured data into readable formats using pandas.
3. **Rule-Based Logic:** Created logic to extract key financial insights.
4. **Chatbot Integration:** Developed a chatbot to provide financial analysis insights based on extracted data.
5. **Testing & Evaluation:** Assessed chatbot accuracy in responding to financial queries.
